            As we navigate through life, we encounter many challenges and questions (e.g., about education, career,
            relationships, parenting, life decisions, etc). Online forums have become good places for us to look for advice.
            However, navigating through many posts is a daunting task, and our goal is to help people find the advice that
            they actually need. And we need your help!
        </p>
        <p class="par">
            In this hit, we ask you to:
        </p>
		<ol class="subtext" style="list-style-type:decimal;">
			<li>read a post asking for advice,</li>
            <li>go to the link provided below and head to our highlighting interface to read the replies to this post,</li>
            <li>
                as you read through the replies, <strong>highlight text spans that give advice</strong>.
                This could be part of a sentence, a single sentence, or multiple sentences.
            </li>
		</ol>
		<p class="par">
            Specifically, an advice is text that the answerer intends the original poster to perceive as
            <strong> a directive to do something that addresses the poster’s question (to their benefit). </strong>
            Mark <u>the longest contiguous text</u> for each piece of advice. It may be helpful to read the entire text once and only
            after that mark the text snippets describing advice.
        </p>
        <p class="par">
            Advice can come in a variety of forms, for example:
        </p>
		<ul class="subtext" style="list-style-type:disc;">
			<li>Direct advice:</li>
            <ul class="subtext" style="list-style-type:circle">
                <li>
                    Using words such as
                    "<span class="example">suggest</span>",
                    "<span class="example">advise</span>",
                    “<span class="example">recommend</span>”
                </li>
                <li>
                    Using verbs such as
                    “<span class="example">can</span>”,
                    “<span class="example">could</span>”,
                    “<span class="example">should</span>”,
                    “<span class="example">may</span>”,
                    “<span class="example">might</span>”,
                    “<span class="example">need</span>”, e.g.,
                    "<i><span class="example">you should...</span></i>",
                    "<i><span class="example">you need to...</span></i>"
                </li>
                <li>
                    Using imperatives, such as
                    "<i><span class="example">Put baking soda and vinegar down the drain</span></i>", or
                    "<i><span class="example">Don’t get worked up because of the tantrum</span></i>"
                </li>
                <li>
                    Using questions, such as
                    "<i><span class="example">why don’t you…</span>s</i>",
                    "<i><span class="example">how about…</span></i>",
                    "<i><span class="example">have you thought about…</span></i>"
                </li>
                <li>
                    Expressing conditions, for example,
                    "<i><span class="example">If I were you, I would…</span></i>"
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Indirect advice:</li>
            <ul class="subtext" style="list-style-type:circle">
                <li>
                    Sentences like
                    "<i><span class="example">One thing you could do is…</span></i>",
                    "<i><span class="example">It won’t hurt to…</span></i>"</li>
                <li>Hints from personal experiences with the intention for the original poster to do the same thing, for example,</li>
                <ul class="subtext" style="list-style-type:square">
                    <li><i>Q: I am having heart palpitations. What should I do?</i></li>
                    <li><i>A: <span class="example">“I also had palpitations. I stumbled upon fish oil that my dad was taking for his heart, and it cleared them out.”</span></i></li>
                </ul>
                <li>Statements that imply an action should (or should not) be taken; below, the answer is clearly directing the original poster not to talk about an issue:</li>
                <ul class="subtext" style="list-style-type:square">
                    <li><i>Q: Do you parents have any advice on how I should handle this going forward?</i></li>
                    <li><i>A: <span class="example">“Talking about it likely was making them more stressed out”</span></i></li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
		</ul>
        <p class="par">
            A good rule of thumb is to see whether the text instructs the original poster to <b>do something that would
            solve the question</b>. Here are some examples that should <u>NOT</u> be considered an advice:
        </p>
        <ul class="subtext" style="list-style-type:disc">
            <li>
                Expressing sentiment, e.g.,
                “<i><span class="counter_example">Parenthood: you will never love and hate something so much.</span></i>”,
                “<i><span class="counter_example">It sounds to me that his family is uneducated in health</span></i>”.
            </li>
            <li>
                Expressing support, e.g.,
                "<i><span class="counter_example">You are enough.</span></i>",
                "<i><span class="counter_example">It’s totally understandable.</span></i>"
            </li>
            <li>
                Generic argumentation, e.g.,
                "<i><span class="counter_example">Everyone is responsible for their own deeds.</span></i>"
            </li>
            <li>
                Information-seeking questions, e.g.,
                "<i><span class="counter_example">How old is your daughter?</span></i>"
            </li>
        </ul>
