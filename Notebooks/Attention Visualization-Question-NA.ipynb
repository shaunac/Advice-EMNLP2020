Once you can manage to keep a plant alive it ’s a sure sign that upon release you will be capable of looking after an animal . Added bonus ( most ) plants wo n't scratch you . The first time I had a root sprout off of a cutting I was super proud of my little plant . It 's fun to watch the systems change and is very rewarding .  \n",

Do you have any other friends ? I have a few other friends be we are not as close . She might not want that kind of responsibility . So maybe after talking   to her and seeing if she ’s upset about something , you might want to consider adding people to your social circle . I help her with her issues and she helps me . Its never really bad but it still helps talking to someone . I call her about one time a week for help . Thanks for your response . Idk if a 14 year old ( her ) is the best way of dealing with your situation . EDIT : Also , in general , it ’s not a good idea to depend on anyone too much .  \n",
       "580  I was thinking of something along these lines . My gosh , ` : 37 ` is all you ’ll be able to remember seeing . You could also probably write an IFTTT to randomly vibrate your phone when the time is n't 1:11 , 2:22 , etc . Alternatively , because OP is obviously assigning value to these times and thus remembering them while forgetting others , perhaps he / she could purposefully pay attention to a different arbitrary pattern . If you want to throw it off , start setting alarms on your phone to be times that are n't 1:11 , 2:22 , etc . As others have said , it 's just confirmation bias . Or a step further , keeping a journal ... > 1:03 > 1:46 > 2:22 > 3:13 > 4:12“Oh , I see I ’m actually just misremembering.”Of course , I ’m no psychologist , and talking to someone qualified is better than following random internet advice . Imagine all the times the clock shows 37 minutes when you look !  \n",
