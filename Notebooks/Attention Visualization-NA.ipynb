You can definitely find something without college but it sounds like you want to go either way . I think that is one of the most stressful fields . I think you need to know firstly that if you are sick stressed just trying to make the choice of college or not ; would emergency medicine even be a good career choice for you ? No matter your choice a quick internet search to find out if you need school to do what you want .  \n",

The reason we do things is to make ourselves feel proud of what we , as a human , can accomplish . My advice is to ween off of whatever you 've been doing in your past time and adventure into a territory of hobby you have n't or too afraid to explore . It 's the sense of victory over what CAN be done . Much love you you , and I hope this helped <3 Maybe this'll give you that sense of interest and achievement you 're looking for . If we repetiviley do the same thing , we 'll eventually think , \" Well , I 've felt this type of success before . and well .... maybe we wo n't feel so proud of it the other time around . PLENTY of times actually . \"  \n",

Yep . You might have simply changed as a person and your old hobbies are n’t “ you ” anymore . Try doing some things you never have done before . Sometimes this is just an indication you need to discover new hobbies because you have moved on from the old ones . You may find the brand new excitement you are searching for .  \n",

Move forward with the interview . Also offer to send him the diagnosis document if he wants to take a look . If you get the offer accept it . If you need to go through any medical procedure ask the doctor how long will it take to join . Most importantly health is wealth and without that nothing can be achieved .

Sports are pretty fun and in highschool ur gon na love it if u keep it up . I will say hobbies are great and can lead u into a future career . You do n't need to be like everyone and have something . A lot of these kids who are doing stuff were pushed by their parents , such as sports so do n't worry Maybe try learning a language , takes 0 dollars and is really helpful . Draw or even just read . I for one have been keeping aquariums half my life and I 'm pursuing a degree in biology and environmental science . That 's not late at all .

A lot of these kids who are doing stuff were pushed by their parents , such as sports so do n't worry Maybe try learning a language , takes 0 dollars and is really helpful . Draw or even just read .

For a class project I think you might be able to use any image , such as something from deviantart.com , just add a site the image with aaption to the image where you got it from and who the artist is . Google 10 free stock image websites . :) Goodluck ! Edit : I 'm personally do n't like the way the stock images with watermarks look- I think that even if you could use them , you should n't and then you 're mark 's should be better because it will look more professional . They do n't ask for credit card details or require you to login . There 's some websites . Nice photos and you can chose what quality you need and you can donate to photographers if you want .  \n",

All the different careers I 've had in my life were doing things that were self - taught - go figure !

       "c8th26-3-2    I was thinking of something along these lines . My gosh , ` : 37 ` is all you ’ll be able to remember seeing . You could also probably write an IFTTT to randomly vibrate your phone when the time is n't 1:11 , 2:22 , etc . Alternatively , because OP is obviously assigning value to these times and thus remembering them while forgetting others , perhaps he / she could purposefully pay attention to a different arbitrary pattern . If you want to throw it off , start setting alarms on your phone to be times that are n't 1:11 , 2:22 , etc . As others have said , it 's just confirmation bias . Or a step further , keeping a journal ... > 1:03 > 1:46 > 2:22 > 3:13 > 4:12“Oh , I see I ’m actually just misremembering.”Of course , I ’m no psychologist , and talking to someone qualified is better than following random internet advice .

Check your work , look up what you got wrong , correct your answers . Identify the information you think is pertinent , write / type it out like a test . Or good ol’ flash cards . Either way , challenge yourself to recall the information in a critical way that encourages you to understand the material , instead of trying to memorize a book . Good luck . This has worked very well for me ! Choose questions / topics that will challenge you . I make myself practice tests / quizzes .  \n",

You are just an acquaintance to them . I would wonder how many secrets they share with you . And I would ask myself the other question in reverse how many secrets do you share with them?And I 'm getting the vibe that you 're a guy , and if that 's the case then you probably do n't do a lot of talking about your feelings and what they mean to you in a serious manner ... That might be a conversation worth having ( even though it 's super uncomfortable ) . If the answer is none , then you are not friends .  \n",

The best advice I have is to not be afraid of making mistakes . Ask yourself what you did enjoy even if you decide not to continue so you can make more informed decisions . No one starts as an expert and learning does n’t ever stop . Your friends may be good at what they do and you might feel a bit left behind right now . If you try something and it ’s not for you then that ’s cool . But that wo n’t always be the case .  \n",

You still want them to be well , but that ’s not your first priority and you ’re no longer sacrificing your happiness for it . One ensures closure and causes pain , and one main seem gentler but in the long run could be worse . I think overall , you just care more about how negatively you ’ve been impacted by the relationship then the positives that your friend receives . Or move and slowly drift apart .  \n",

Check your work , look up what you got wrong , correct your answers . Identify the information you think is pertinent , write / type it out like a test . Or good ol’ flash cards . Either way , challenge yourself to recall the information in a critical way that encourages you to understand the material , instead of trying to memorize a book . Good luck . This has worked very well for me ! Choose questions / topics that will challenge you . I make myself practice tests / quizzes .  \n",

Makes you more well rounded career options . When mix soft and hard , physics might become ok again . Also , you might partly be super burned out as focus on one subject only . Might need to and less burnout . Also if double major , consider extra year / s . Double major , physics and philosophy and or history . Finally , you like solve ideas , find out more about physics jobs , might be more or less like what you hate or like .  "

Yes , I agree with the idea of looking into a program that might be labeled as \" residential \" which requires you to live onsite and attend treatment regularly , but does not restrict you to a sterile and isolated medical facility . Is there the option for supervised trips off site ? Kind of like a stepping stone between inpatient and independence . That would likely be a good stepping stone especially considering mom has to sign off on the release . If so , you can see if volunteering at an animal shelter may be an option .

Academically wise , it ’s slightly harder than high school yet a bit easier than university . It was nearly a 2.8 . Ended community college with a 3.6 . There ’s not much of a downside minus your social life if you care too much about it . I was accepted into some decent universities , but I opted to enter community college instead . Saved money , and it ’ll allow yourself some time to figure out what you truly want to do .  \n",

She was in a bad space mentally and refused any help , and refused to do anything to help herself . Best of luck I ve gone through nearly the exact situation . She also was kind of a selfish and shitty friend . Eventually she asked me if we were still friends and I explained to her why it 's not the best thing for me moving forward . Just let him know that you appreciate and cherish his friendship and now its time for both of you to grow . I kinda Iced her out for a few months because I resented her , and we used to spend like everyday together .  \n",

Regardless , i hope things improve for you ! If you are interested in some book titles i will gladly tell you the ones that have helped me . I respect that it would be a depressing environment but i do n't think a pet or your own place will be the answer you are hoping for .

       "am40cu-1-3    Sometimes us in the bipolar / bpd crowd need a bit of a firm hand with love . He 's acting like you 're his slave leading to codependency . All I can do is give you advice and support you , but when you 're rude to me it hurts , and I 'm not going to condone you hurting me . \" I 'm a psych nurse and this is what I would tell him . Reminding of love is a great idea and a good start but the firmness is also a necessity . As someone who is has borderline personality disorder ( basically bipolar but much quicker cycles between manic and depressive ) , say this to him ! Something like\"Hey , I love you and I want to support you in living a good life . Next time he 's rude you , remind him what your role.is in his life . But I have my own life to worry about and it 's not my job to find meaning for your life . Establish clear boundaries or else he will try to make your life his and you wo n't be able to live your own life .  \n",

Regardless , i hope things improve for you ! If you are interested in some book titles i will gladly tell you the ones that have helped me .

A good place to start would maybe be some counselling and trying to engage in positive lifestyle choices ( good diet , exercise , etc ) . You could also go see a doctor and get antidepressants if needed . A lack of interest in previously enjoyed activities is a major symptom of depression , as others have stated .  \n",

I knew it would devastate me and be terrible . Do n’t get annoyed with their random idiosyncrasies . Do n’t get irritated by them lecturing or giving advice . Save voicemails if possible .  \n",

Slowly I started being able to leave my house , even if only for 30mins or so . Then maybe try going outside and doing something to take your mind off it . If I were you , I would talk to them about it and talk to some friends about it . I had this when I was about 12 - 15 or so .  \n",

You might end up doing something else along the way , but the experience and education will be useful no matter what . So if you want to do EMS then go for it . All the different careers I 've had in my life were doing things that were self - taught - go figure ! If expenses are a concern , start at community college if you can and make it your life 's mission to seek out all the possible scholarships and grants you can find .

I ’m the same way ! Something that has helped me is to give myself a monthly “ allowance ” that I HAVE to spend on something I would enjoy . It has worked really well for me . Not something I need , but something I want . Start with a small budget if it ’s hard for you to spend and just increase it .  \n",

Something you can consider is scheduling these hobbies into your life the same way you do your classes / work etc . ” “ When I finish my morning coffee , I will start my new hobby . Set aside a specific time each week to learn video editing or another hobby . ” For example , “ When I finish eating dinner , I will practice video editing . You can also try making a plan that starts with “ when .  \n",

You might end up doing something else along the way , but the experience and education will be useful no matter what . So if you want to do EMS then go for it . All the different careers I 've had in my life were doing things that were self - taught - go figure ! If expenses are a concern , start at community college if you can and make it your life 's mission to seek out all the possible scholarships and grants you can find . I went to college after high school and got a degree in a field I love but did n't actually get a job doing anything close to that . I am sometimes indecisive , too .  \n",

Sports are pretty fun and in highschool ur gon na love it if u keep it up . I will say hobbies are great and can lead u into a future career . You do n't need to be like everyone and have something . A lot of these kids who are doing stuff were pushed by their parents , such as sports so do n't worry Maybe try learning a language , takes 0 dollars and is really helpful . Draw or even just read . I for one have been keeping aquariums half my life and I 'm pursuing a degree in biology and environmental science . That 's not late at all . Rn I would do relatively cheap hobbies unless ur parents are willing to support you .  \n",

I will attempt to get some help . I 've been that friend before . I was a friend 's entire support system for years , and it was too much for me to handle . Thank you for the comment . She is probably pulling away because she ca n't be your support system . I became depressed from trying .  \n",

She was in a bad space mentally and refused any help , and refused to do anything to help herself . Best of luck I ve gone through nearly the exact situation . She also was kind of a selfish and shitty friend . Eventually she asked me if we were still friends and I explained to her why it 's not the best thing for me moving forward . Just let him know that you appreciate and cherish his friendship and now its time for both of you to grow . I kinda Iced her out for a few months because I resented her , and we used to spend like everyday together .  \n",

I suggest you see a therapist , because it must be quite jarring not to be able to stop doing things In my case I 'm scared of what will happen when they die and if I will be able.to.overcome the grief .  \n",

Taking Zoloft has helped with the obsessive worrying and fear . But be warned , it takes 4 - 6 weeks for meds to kick in and you have to stick with it- it ’s worth it . I have this issue also . See if medication helps . It sounds like you have generalized anxiety and it ’s manifesting with this particular fixation . I find that it keeps me from going down those horrifying rabbit holes of dark thoughts .  \n",

It 's the sense of victory over what CAN be done . Much love you you , and I hope this helped <3 Maybe this'll give you that sense of interest and achievement you 're looking for . If we repetiviley do the same thing , we 'll eventually think , \" Well , I 've felt this type of success before . and well .... maybe we wo n't feel so proud of it the other time around .

Someone mentioned plants which are also great . If you have a job it sounds like you are leaving the hospital regularly . Yes , I agree with the idea of looking into a program that might be labeled as \" residential \" which requires you to live onsite and attend treatment regularly , but does not restrict you to a sterile and isolated medical facility . Is there the option for supervised trips off site ? Kind of like a stepping stone between inpatient and independence . That would likely be a good stepping stone especially considering mom has to sign off on the release . If so , you can see if volunteering at an animal shelter may be an option . Are you required to stay in the facility around the clock ? Pet therapy is the only thing that truly helped me .  \n",

The only advice I can think of is to take advantage of the moments you get with everyone you care about . Do n’t let things anger you for too long . Life is n’t worth the hassle of holding hate in your heart . Every once in a while I fabricate instances in my head where I get a phone call or a text that my best friend passed away and it scares me every time because we ’ve been best friends since 1st grade ( 16 years now ) and idk what I ’d do if I would n’t be able to talk to him ever again .  \n",

It 's the sense of victory over what CAN be done . Much love you you , and I hope this helped <3 Maybe this'll give you that sense of interest and achievement you 're looking for . If we repetiviley do the same thing , we 'll eventually think , \" Well , I 've felt this type of success before . and well .... maybe we wo n't feel so proud of it the other time around .
