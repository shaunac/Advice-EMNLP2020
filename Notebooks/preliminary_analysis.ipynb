       " \"i keep seeing articles about how childbirth in a hospital is around $30k. but how much of that did you actually pay, after insurance? if anyone has a figure, how much did it cost in total from buying the pregnancy test all the way to taking the kid home? including prenatal vitamins, maternity clothes, etc. im trying to conpare the cost of giving birth to the cost of adopting. edit: im referring to the out of pocket cost in backwards america, where it costs the most to give birth, and where women are most likely to die from it. edit 2: so adoption costs anywhere from 20k to 50k. most out of pocket expenses for birth range from $500 to $5k. it looks like the highest out of pocket expense was around 18k, and that was for an emergency situation. i guess it's cheaper to damage one's body through childbirth than to aid a child in need. i am hoping to get sterilized soon, but i was afraid of potentially changing my mind in the future about raising a kid (see also: ruining my life). i guess i can always ruin my life for about 20k extra, sans falopian tubes if that's what i so desired.\",\n",

       " 'am i the only one who thinks camp sunscreen policies are out of hand? i was on facebook today and saw a post about finding sunscreen that\\'s easy for a young child to apply without assistance. as summer vacation has arrived or is fast approaching, parents are dealing with summer camps that have one rule about sunscreen: adults are not allowed to assist in applying. personally, i think that is absolutely insane. as an adult, you better believe that if i\\'m at the beach or pool, i\\'m going to turn to a friend or a stranger who looks nice and ask \"hey, can you help get my back?\" or \"i\\'ll help with your back if you help with mine.\" i have very sensitive skin. i am fully aware that, one day, i will have to face the ramifications of the multiple sunburns i\\'ve experienced over the years (including a couple that blistered pretty badly). i wouldn\\'t wish that kind of pain on anyone- especially not a young child. some camps are willing to spray sunscreen on backs, but i do not trust aeresol sunscreen. it\\'s very difficult to ensure full coverage, and when sunsceen is applied/reapplied outdoors,any breeze can lead to large patches of skin being missed. (the last time i used a spray sunscreen, i ended up with second-degree sunburn). applying once in the morning isn\\'t going to be enough- especially when children are spending hours outdoors sweating or exposed to water. teach your child how to apply sunscreen to his/her own arms and legs, but i still think that it\\'s perfectly reasonable for a camp counselor to help get hard-to-reach spots or make sure that nothing was missed. if you do not trust your child\\'s counselors enough to help apply sunscreen to areas not covered by a swimsuit \\\\[isn\\'t the general guidance for kids is that \"private areas\" are areas that are covered by a swimsuit\\\\], then do you really trust them?',\n",
       " 'i don\\'t know what to do anymore, i really need help. hey [r/](https://www.reddit.com/r/parenting/)askparents, i really am in need of either a sympathetic ear or someone to go to for advice. i\\'m just tired of dealing with bs. i did try posting to r/parenting, but apparently the mods think that you have to be a biological parent to post there to ask for help. as a tl;dr, i have a 4 year old sister who i fear will grow up to have a lot of social problems/mental issues because of the way she is treated in our family. in general, i feel our family dynamic is incredibly toxic. i\\'m 20 years old, and her only brother, for what that\\'s worth. our immediate family consists of my father and my other three sisters. my mother unfortunately passed two years ago. my grandma also contributes to her care-taking as well. also, for what it\\'s worth, none of us siblings really asked for, or were ready for a sister, let alone attempting to raise her. i believe that it has made my sisters resentful of her, as she is often \"pawned off\" on them in my opinion. i try to be considerate of the fact that our youngest sister didn\\'t ask for this situation either, and is even more lost than we are in all likelihood. i\\'ll start by listing our respective styles of interacting with her, and finish by listing her behavior as of recently. me: i try my best to do everything \"by the book,\" try giving her warnings, rewards, spending time with her, timeouts, etc. she doesn\\'t seem all to interested in me, as she quickly wants to spend more time with my sisters, specifically the second oldest. i believe she finds them more similar to her than i am to her, and she thinks she can do more with them than i can with her. i was also not really permitted to take care of her when she was younger but did my best to spend time with her. i don\\'t think my methods work well as she has 4 other people with different methods she always goes to when \"i\\'m being mean.\" i\\'ve raised my voice, but never yelling, and never intentionally hurtful. i try to reward her for good behavior, and give her timeout/ silent treatment for bad, but i\\'m not sure if i\\'m doing that right. in the past i\\'ve messed up pretty badly, and will go into more detail depending on anyone that asks. father: my father, is in my opinion, a responsible parent, but not much else. just based off of my own personal experience, i\\'ve never really seen him as someone to go to for help, advice, to talk to, etc. he is incredibly negative sometimes, and is very good at bumming me out. the reason i\\'m bringing that up is because this is how he treats my sister, in a sense. he doesn\\'t really spend time with her because he doesn\\'t really know how, but will always make sure she\\'s fed, clothed, clean, and in otherwise good health. he spoils her by always taking her side in almost every tantrum she throws and gives her whatever she wants. he will sometimes raise his voice at her, actually yelling, but that is very rare. he usually pawns her off on my sisters, in my opinion. mother: though she died, when she was alive, my mother was afflicted with a debilitating cancer. she spent as much time with my sister as possible, but there was only so much she could do. as a result and a very easy way out, she gave my sister an ipad to watch youtube kids on. since then she does not really part with it and everyone in the family just gives it to her out of frustration. i tried to warn my mother, but i couldn\\'t convince anyone that that was a bad thing to do. she was the person out of the family who gave her the most attention when she could, however. grandmother: i will make no secret of the disdain i hold for how my grandmother cares for my sister. from what i\\'ve been told, my grandmother is old-world and believes that a literal slap on the wrist is alright for discipline, and she also spoils my sister heavily. this is all what i\\'ve heard but the people who have told me that do not have any compelling reason to lie to me about it. sister (eldest): this sister is easily the most authoritarian out of my whole family. she is very strict/straight-forward with our little sister. her version of timeout is closing the door of a room (with nothing dangerous in the room) and staying on the other side. she has a no bs attitude, and it doesn\\'t really mix well with our little sister\\'s defiant, childish attitude. she does yell at her, but never in any malicious or cruel way. this sister does not mix well with people questioning her methods, and will often take care of our sister just to spite people sometimes. sister (2nd): this sister is very happy go lucky in terms of personality. whereas everyone else in my family is relatively serious, she is not. this leads to her being able to bond very well with our younger sister, to the point that she (4 year old) prefers spending time with only her. my sister is not able to handle this on a consistent basis in the slightest. this leads to sister 2 being cold sometimes, and pawning her off to one of us or just putting her on her ipad. this also leads to her spoiling her the most, and basically jumping to conclusions in situations like our sister hitting someone and being told to go to timeout, and then just telling her to say sorry and it\\'ll be okay. sister (3rd): this sister makes no secret that she has a noticeable temper and warns us that when she loses it she does stupid things, and she can\\'t control it sometimes. in my opinion sister 3 has the worst relationship with our sister out of the three. she has yelled at our youngest sister, told her mean things like \"nobody likes you,\" and is the least accommodating of her in general. youngest sister\\'s behavior at this point: my youngest sister at this point is pretty happy go lucky, and also extremely defiant. if you tell her to stop doing something, she will sometimes treat it like a joke, even if you get angry with her. in fact, the angrier you get, the funnier she seems to think it is. timeout is impossible, because she never sits still long enough or takes it seriously enough to stay in it. when she throws tantrums, she has started slamming doors, yelling at the top of her lungs, and justifying it with \"they were mean to me\" even though i\\'ve taught her time and time again to come talk to me or one of us instead of that. she uses the word no a lot, and always wants things her way. i\\'m not sure how much of this is normal behavior and how much isn\\'t. she lives with basically no rules, which i\\'m very against. she eats whatever she wants and doesn\\'t go to bed at consistent times. she also still sleeps with my sisters/dad. i\\'m very against that, because she should learn how to sleep on her own, but my dad says she needs more time. my sisters want the same, but i feel they only say that because it would benefit them with better sleep. i want her to grow up happy and better than we did, and i feel very guilty anytime i see her, knowing that we might screw her up. at the same time, i\\'m lost, because everyone seems to have different ideas for taking care of her, and at this point it has become easier to just cave and not have to deal with the headache that comes with trying to convince my family of certain things. what should i do?',\n",

so i'm 25 weeks pregnant on friday! i'm almost to the 3rd trimester and it's finally starting to weigh on me. i've got 5 cats and 1 dog as of right now. i live in a 3 bedroom house, with a full garage, and a fully fenced in back yard. as of now, it seems like we have a lot of room and not too much to worry about... i've been told since we started trying to have a baby that i was going to need to get rid of some of my cats. 2 of them are looooooong haired white cats, and one of them sheds everywhere. 2 of them are shorter haired but they're only 2 years old and they don't shed a lot. the last one is my childhood pet, a short haired black cat, and she is 16+ years old now, however she sheds quite a bit as well in her old age. 4 of the cats are related because i accidentally rescued blurryface (that's her name) and i didn't know she was pregnant... *backstory on blurryface... i was trying to find a friend for my old dog (which past away last summer from cancer) and i went to these people's house and it was complete madness! the two dogs they tried to get me to buy had splotches of hair missing and looked 10 years old. after i refused the dogs, they asked me to come inside and look at the rest of their pets. through the front door was a whole entire wall of reptiles in glass cages, stacked on top of each other. up the stairs, in the hall was a huge bunny in a long cage with no lining; it was just a bunny in a cage with shit covering the wire... lastly, they took me to the back bedroom and opened up the door that was home to at least 20 cats! i couldn't believe it! all these cats in such a small room and they didn't even try to leave because the woman was screaming at them to stay back. i was literally turning around to leave that hellhole and then blurryface walked right up to the edge of the room. pure white, tiny tiny kitty with blue eyes. i had always wanted a white, longhaired cat, and there she was!! she just looked at me and then meowed at me... but no sound came out. i picked her up and i could hold her, all the way around, with one hand... i scooped her up, gave the woman $10 and went back to my little tiny quadplex with my big pit bull and called animal control on that crazy family. when she got home, she didn't stop eating for days... i was afraid her stomach was going to blow up! after a few weeks, i noticed she was a little round and i took her to the vet, thinking she might have worms or a tumor. they told me immediately that she wasn't sick... just pregnant!! they took me back to the ultrasound room and i got to see my very first ultrasound ever... and we saw 8. fucking. kittens. so, i ended up moving to a bigger house, and she had the kittens. there were too many for her to take care of on her own so i helped bottle feed them and watched them all grow up!! obviously i couldn't keep 8 kittens... and i honestly kept them wayyy too long but i ended up getting rid of all but 3 of them and i was only meant to keep 2. my friend backed out of taking pz, but by then i couldn't part ways with him anyway!!* anyway, sorry for the long explanation but i think you should be able to understand our relationship now... anyway, so i've got the 5 cats and the 1 dog, ramsey. last year, my husband promised me (and ramsey) a puppy. ramsey had a friend for a while and he was soo happy, until we gave her to my mil and then the dog ran away... so ramsey was devastated and still kinda is... we found out that someone we know was having auggie (australian shepherd and corgi) puppies!!!! we immediately gave her the downpayment ($250 out of $800) for the puppy... and then like a week later found out we were pregnant... so now, we are left with this dilemma of having a ton of animals when the baby is born. after talks over months, we reached a consensus that blurryface would be the best one to go because she sheds the most, she likes to smother you while cuddling, and sometimes she potties outside the litterbox.... so i procrastinated so long that the puppy is now ready to be picked up and brought home and we still have 5 cats... i tried to ask our families if they could take her; a hard no. then i got it set up for my friend to take her... then he apparently got another cat because i took too long to respond... so my last resort was to try to rehome her on facebook... i posted the ad, while tears were running down my face, and i was met with such hatefulness! i was using a pet rehoming group, explained my situation and was repeatedly told that i was a bad person, and that having 5 cats and 2 dogs was going to be just fine... my husband made me take the post down because i was just losing it... but i know he's not happy that we haven't rehomed her yet... and it's not like he doesn't love her or wouldn't miss the fuck out of her, but i promised i would part ways with at least one of them... after the whole blow up on facebook the other day, it's made me feel so hopefull! they made it seem like it won't be all that bad and that it could be worked out... i just keep hearing horror stories about cats and babies and i'm scared... i'd rather be safe than sorry but this is my family! they've been my family longer than i've known my husband. they've been through so much with me... and at this point, the puppy is paid off because we were under the impression my friend was going to take her... it's all a big mess and i don't know what to do. we already planned on trying to make two of the kittens outside cats (because they want it) so that's one thing... but it still seems like a lot. what are your thoughts? i'm due october 3rd and we are having a planned c-section.\",\n",

       " 'back home and living with my dad.... i\\'m horrified and i don\\'t know what to do back in may, i (24f) moved back home to live with my dad (61m), his wife (33f), and their two children (9m, 5m). whenever i have been home (uk), i have been involved with my brothers somehow. for two summers before, my dad \\'employed\\' me as an au pair for them and paid me for the work i did. i play with them and keep them entertained; baking, taking them to the park, swimming, just as much as i can to keep them off their tablets/phones. (i can\\'t believe they have their own tech so young, but that\\'s another issue). it\\'s just such a hostile environment, i feel like i\\'m damage control to these boys. whatever my dad and his wife have done in the way of discipline, it definitely hasn\\'t worked. usually they use smacking the kids\\' hands and shouting at them, and it could be for the littlest thing. and, usually, he takes it out on the older kid while the younger one could **literally** get away with murder. his wife is the angriest person i have ever met. she\\'s from south-east asia (not specifying for anonymity) and she uses that as an excuse to be a \\'tiger mom\\'; most of her interactions with the kids are her screaming at them and making them cry. she\\'ll even scream at my dad in the middle of the night. (when she did this i knocked on the door asking her if she could stop screaming, because obviously the whole house is trying to sleep. she just got worse and started yelling at my dad for \\'not being able to control his daughter\\'.) she can\\'t take any responsibility for her own actions, and always deflects the blame onto someone else (usually my dad or her eldest son). we know she has depression and takes meds for that, and she has her own part-time job and we got her into gardening to try calm her down, which has worked a little bit. i\\'ve told my dad that she needs to see a psychiatrist for her anger issues at least, but again, she doesn\\'t think she\\'s doing anything wrong so i sincerely doubt that would help. i know she\\'s had some issues in her childhood but i don\\'t think that\\'s an excuse for what she is inflicting on her own children. my dad isn\\'t innocent in this either. he\\'s the primary caregiver most of the time, and does try to be a good parent when he has the energy. he doesn\\'t shout as often, but he still smacks. he\\'s especially hard on the older boy, and genuinely believes that the 9yo is the bully in the situation a lot of the time. here is my observation: my dad and his wife bully the 9yo (making things out to be his fault), then the 9yo takes it out on the 5yo as a way to regain control maybe, but the 5yo bullies back. then my dad and his wife punish the 9yo for being a bully while letting the 5yo off with his behaviour. if the kids are unhappy, they\\'ve learned that being hit and being shouted at is \\'ok\\' but they can\\'t hit or shout back, so they hit each other (and are then punished for it). the 5yo is so manipulative, and keeps saying things like \"i\\'m the boss!\" \"you\\'re not the boss of me.\" \"you have to do what i say.\" he\\'s not getting corrected for this, and his parents usually do what he tells them to. he never says \\'please\\' or \\'thank you\\' unless prompted, and usually asks for things in the \"i want (x) now\" format. in other words; he\\'s a proper brat and a demon child. it\\'s a vicious circle and i don\\'t know how to stop it. at the moment, my dad isn\\'t employing me and i\\'m instead just another occupant in the house. when i\\'ve been in charge, i\\'ve used the time out technique a few times (mainly on the 5yo because he\\'s an actual demon) and it works. i had to repeat the cycle 5 times the first time i used it, but now when i give him a warning for his behaviour he takes me seriously and pipes down. sometimes even when i\\'m not in charge, when i see that his parents don\\'t do anything i tend to discipline instead. (which ends up being a much quicker and calmer affair than when they do it). i\\'m disappointed for the 5yo because he\\'s not learning proper behaviour and turning into a demon child, but i\\'m scared for the 9yo. my heart breaks for him. dad\\'s wife got an 8-ball for christmas, and i saw the 9yo playing with it when noone was looking. do you know what he asked it: \"does my mummy love me?\" no child should have to feel like that and it kills me. it makes me want to cry as i\\'m typing this. most days i\\'m just trying to work out if it\\'s acceptable for me to kidnap him and raise him as my own. i just feel at such a loss here. i don\\'t know what to do, or who to ask for help. given that they are my brothers, and not my children (but it\\'s still my dad raising them), what power do i have in this situation? parents of reddit, how should i approach this? edit: adding tl;dr : i\\'m worried for how my kid brothers are being raised and need advice.',\n",

i have 5 children that i raise. 3 are mine and the other 2 are my brother and sister. i have had to step up and be mom and dad for all of these kids. my grandmother does help me raise them. the last 2 years has been drama on and off and its caused by one certain child (my 14 yr old brother) who is always given his way by our grandmother he is basically the \"golden child\" i have been in complete control in raising the other 4 kids (5yr old, 8yr old, 12yr old, 14yr old) the only reason i haven\\'t been in control of raising the other child is because he has found out over time that i\\'m not a pushover and he cant get his way when it comes to me but my grandmother will give him anything he wants and let him get away with anything even charging on her credit cards without permission and her being on a fixed income and not having money to pay for them. the other children have chores and have rules they must follow at all times. however this one child does not have rules nor is he made to do chores he can cuss do as he pleases just like he is grown and throw a temper tantrum and my grandmother will give him his way! over the last couple years i have had to fight tooth and nail to get my grandmother to make him attend school he was getting checked out for everything under the sun last year and took to doctors and emergency rooms bc of \"illnesses\" it was so bad that she eventually let him finish the rest of the year being homeschooled. all of the doctors btw signed off on everything and said he was perfectly fine just constipation and they even pulled him out of the hospital room to talk to him one on one bc they wanted to make sure nothing like child abuse or anything was happening at home. he did not even complete the homeschool program she ended up doing it herself just so he wouldn\\'t be held back. he was re-enrolled this year back into school its only like 4 weeks into school year and its happening again! he has already gotten checked out twice and now he is claiming that he is in so much pain from his \"nonexistent medical condition\" and he is so depressed and has so much anxiety and it hurts to pee and so on and so on if it has popped in his head as an excuse he could use that may help him in his case he has used it. he is throwing violent temper tantrums breaking his computer screen storming out of the house and the list goes on this all happens when he isn\\'t given his way! my grandmother is not in the best of health and he waits until i\\'m not around and she is by herself to lock himself in the room with her and give her a pity party and degrade her and try to make her feel sorry for him and even has recently resulted to threatening \"that he cant take it anymore he is done\" so he is basically using suicidal threats as a thing to hold over her head if she doesn\\'t give in to him. he will tattle tale on all the other children and make up these horrible lies on them if he doesn\\'t get his way and what he wants! even though what he is tattling about is irrelevant to what he is wanting to be able to do! he has said he is too sick, in pain, depressed, embarrassed of the color of the house paint, embarrassed to have to attend the same school as one of the other children, embarrassed of the car we drive, doesn\\'t have a normal family home with two parents, doesn\\'t have his own room, the other kids get on his nerves he can\\'t mentally handle them, even bringing up my deceased father who passed away when he was 5 by saying how \"sorry of a person he was\" which isn\\'t true and he doesn\\'t even remember him! the other night he texted me while i was out shopping for one of the other childrens birthday gifts saying he needed to talk to me he was severely depressed then he proceeds to tell me he only wants to talk thru text message (btw he will completely avoid me and wont say anything to me and only will go to my grandmother if he is lying that is a for sure sign he is trying to con her) well he then tells me he is depressed and has anxiety and all this other stuff so of course i kick into mom mode and start reaching out to get him the resources and tools he needs well after he told me stuff that he knew would grab my attention he then says so if i ask you to do something will you yes or no and i tell him it depends but i will always do what is best for them so then he replies with take me out of school and homeschool me if you really care if you want what is best for me and i told him absolutely not he is making good grades and claims he doesn\\'t get bullied it basically all boils down to he doesn\\'t want to be at school he wants to be home sleeping until 11 or 12 and staying up all night sitting in front of his computer playing video games well once i said no we aren\\'t just going to take you out of school unless we have exhausted all other options and resources and they don\\'t work! i suggested counseling, family therapy, changing his schedule from all ap classes to just regular classes and teaching him coping skills that i have been taught that help me control my anxiety and depression and a few other things that would actually help him if he truly is having anxiety and depression. he then says \"well you don\\'t care about me i am giving you one month or im done (trying to threaten suicide) then he tells me that he doesn\\'t want my help anymore he will deal with it he knows what is best for him and that he has been hiding it from us for this long he can do it again (btw he was perfectly fine all summer long he even took a trip out of the country for 6 weeks with his grandfather). not one time did i say or insinuate that i thought he was making it up or lying i was letting him know how truly concerned i was and that i was there for him and would do anything to help him (i struggle with anxiety, depression, ptsd etc. so i know how terrifying it is to have to deal with it and especially being only 14). i have had numerous talks with my grandmother and even had her watch youtube videos on how children will try to manipulate you also i have a friend who is a therapist and she is coming over to talk with me and my grandmother about what she thinks we need to do. i found out this morning from my grandmother that he went into her room last night telling her a bunch of horrible lies about the other kids in the house and things he is saying they are doing outside of the home or who they are hanging out with and so on. but i 100000000% know that the other children go to school (i have life 360 on their phones) i constantly monitor their grades they are making awesome grades, then they come home after school they get a snack do their chores and homework and the older two(12, and 14) out of the four help me with supper or getting the younger two(5, and 8) ready for bed or anything else that i may need help with. then they get their own selves ready for bed. the four i have say over are very respectful and know better than to do the things that 1 child is doing. bc i have been the one raising them and not putting them on a pedestal and catering to their every single want and need and i hold them accountable for their actions and i don\\'t feed into negative or bad behavior. i look at it as i\\'m not just raising children but i\\'m raising children who will one day be an adult and i want them to be productive members of society. i don\\'t whip my children and they are not afraid of me they just respect me and know that if they respect me i will respect them. but anyways its not right to me that this 1 child wants to ,for one upset my grandmother with lies and down grading her or throwing a temper tantrum knowing she has heart problems and doesn\\'t need the stress and ,for two he has no right to \"throw the other kids under the bus\" in order to make is hisself look all high and mighty and i truly don\\'t know why he is even saying these lies bc they are completely irrelevant to what he is wanting us to give in to! please help i am desperate not for myself but for my other children who are getting the shit end of this situation! he thinks he is grown and refuses to listen or respect me or my grandmother! he is tearing our family apart and causing problems and its not fair to the other children to have to live day by day worrying about if he is going to make a lie up about them today to benefit himself!',\n",

       " 'question to parents. please help parents. i need some advice. (long read) (sorry) my mom left us when i was around 5. i resent her. my dad was always at work so i didn\\'t get a lot of time with him. he was also depressed about losing his wife so we didn\\'t get a chance at any kind of bonding. my dad remarried eventually. my step mom treated me and my brother unfairly. she admits it. my step mom has this negative \"thing\" towards me which she agreed to be true at one point. like, she has harsher reactions to my mistakes and questions. i am 26 and i recently realized how much my step mom gave me and how much she means to me. yes she treated me unfairly but she gave me the basic things i needed in life in sense of direction and ethics. i do a lot for this family. at one point when my dad lost his job i was the one bringing in the income for the whole family for several years. i did not complain one bit because i knew that\\'s what i needed to do. some examples of how i\\'m being treated: 1. everybody will have their shoes out by the door. 1 pair of my shoes will be there and 1 pair of my flip flops which someone else took will be there too. guess who gets yelled at for the mess. i have 2 brothers that live with me who are completely capable of cleaning up after themselves 2. everyone will be downstairs watching tv. i will go upstairs and play an online game with the guys. she comes in my room and starts complaining that i\\'m wasting time playing games again! (i rarely play games) 3. i do 90% of all grocery shopping for the family. my little brother will request chocolate on the phone when i\\'m at the store already, after the shopping list is made. i forgot to grab that chocolate because i struggle with my memory and i rely on the shopping list to not forget anything. she will be outraged and send me back to the store because he needs his chocolate i do struggle with my memory. she knows it. but she does nothing to help me with it. instead she gets angry when i forget things. i legitimately forget and it\\'s not something i can control. i\\'ve tried so many things to help train my memory. i am not emotionally stable. i overthink everything and sometimes i will just have a bad day or just feel down. when she notices she immediately starts \"oh look he is having his mood again.\" as if i purposefully decided that i want to go around and ruin everyone\\'s day. shouldn\\'t parents notice and ask what\\'s wrong? try to help? she just assumes that i am upset because she yelled at me for something the other day and refuses to believe otherwise. i\\'ve shown her that i want to be close to her. i want to be friends with her so badly and don\\'t know how else to show it without having them think that i\\'m attracted to her in that way. my cousin came over and she shows that side of her to him that i so dearly missed all of my life. when she interacts with him i get this feeling like someone took a dagger and slowly pushes it into my heart. the more i see their interactions with each other the more knives i feel being slowly pushed into my heart. she asks him all of the questions a mom would ask a son; 1. whats up? 2. how did it go? 3. are you feeling better? 4. how\\'s your acne? let me find something that can help 5. what do you think about this? 6. what\\'s your opinion on this? and they have a lot of inside jokes and more personalized conversations. she shares so much more with him than she does with me. i tried to be a part of their conversations a few times and i just get ignored. when i\\'m sick she doesn\\'t offer to help. she just tells me to drink tea or something and won\\'t ask me if i\\'m feeling better. she will only show concern if i am really sick. like when i had appendicitis, i was really sick and she actually showed she cared for me. i have sever dandruff and other skin conditions and i feel like i have to face it on my own without a mother\\'s \"concern\". she will never compliment me. feels like she always puts me down. it feels like any idea that i have is automatically flagged as a stupid idea. i always try to be considerate by being quite when she is sleeping, cleaning up when i see that she is tired, doing chores that she normally does, make her bed when they \"forget to\". most i can get is 1 thank you. but she will never do anything like that for me. she will call me downstairs and tell me to take something to my room that i forgot to. she could have brought it to my room because she was going upstairs anyways. i get blamed for so much. sometimes when we have no work, i get blamed for not trying and thinking about where to get work. when somebody makes a mess or does something that she hates, her automatic reaction is to suspect that i did it. i\\'ve tried to talk to them. i\\'ve tried to voice my feelings but they always find a way to turn it around to where the problem is with me. i tried to believe them and i tried hard to have friendly and caring interaction with them but eventually it always comes crumbling down to me being depressed and parents being annoyed by my depression. i\\'m not sure how sever my depression is because i usually just feel numb now. maybe the sadness never left and it\\'s just my normal mental state. i\\'m honestly tired of all of the quarreling. i had nobody to teach me what she expects from me. what life expects from me. i sincerely do want to improve, in every aspect. i want to have better memory, better ideas, better mental health, better physical health, better social health. but i feel that the way she treats me forces me to build a wall around me and i just can\\'t whatsoever improve on anything. i have not improved on anything and she is annoyed and surprised that after all of these years i can\\'t get anything down. she has to control everything. i have noticed that 90% of all of my thoughts are about my relationship with my parents. i put my family first. i don\\'t care for work, friends, money or anything like i care for a good relationship with her. i can\\'t stop overthinking and stressing about how she treats me. we had a \"cold war\" type of situation recently where i was really down because she was treating me extra harshly and she was really annoyed that i was upset. i was depressed and honestly didn\\'t care about a single thing, not even my life. they were leaving out of town for vacation and i didn\\'t want to go because i didn\\'t want to be around them. i guess she gave in and came up to me and said in a good attitude \"hey son, so we\\'re leaving. i hope everything will be ok?\". in an instant i teared up and gave her a hug and i told her that i still love her. she said she loves me to. i\\'ve tried telling both parent\\'s about how i feel when she treats my cousin like she loves him and treats me like i\\'m an employee. their excuse \"he\\'s a relative. your mom loves you\". he\\'s a relative so he gets treated normally but i\\'m your son. who does so much for you. if i was in the position, i would leave them and live on my own without even thinking about it. i have no friends and i am not able to be friends with my parent\\'s (which i want so so much). but if i leave then the family business falls apart and my parents won\\'t be able to survive. my dad has bad health and both parents don\\'t speak well enough english. they won\\'t be able to survive without my help and i can\\'t let them lose the house and everything. i think maybe god put us in this position because we have to change. otherwise we will fall apart. (i\\'m christian) what more can i do as a step son? all i want, literally, is to be treated like a friend. like a son. like i\\'m on their team. i don\\'t want harsh reactions, harsh answers, harsh life. my life has already been pretty harsh. i know she has that side of her that i feel i need. i\\'ve gotten to a point in my life where i no longer feel like things need to change. i know that i can\\'t continue if things don\\'t change. i\\'ve already changed a lot. just for the sake of improving my relationship with my step mom i have changed and she noticed herself. she told others that i am a completely different person. i am trying so hard but they seem unwilling to change or listen to me. what more can i do?',\n",

       " 'i need some help regarding my kid brother (14yo) tl;dr at the end so a little backstory. my brother is currently 14, i am 26. when my brother was born i was essentially a third parent to him (changing diapers, lots of babysitting, spending quality time, and teaching him things). he was always energetic, excited, funny, and outgoing. my parents fought a lot during this time so i was always very protective of him and always felt close. anyway, once middle school started for him, i noticed he definitely started to develop some social anxiety. i)n elementary school this wasn\\'t the case; he was loud, and had a good amount of friends.) this, of course, seems normal to me since i have it as well. however, i noticed, definitely by the end of 8th grade (june of this year), he had really gone south in regards to his social anxiety. he was completely disengaged from school activities and friends. my parents let my brother have a laptop and a smart phone when by the time he was a bout 10. i really tried to get them to be strict about screen time, but they essentially let him be on his phone and laptop for as long as he wanted. since i am older, i have a life and responsibilities, and wasn\\'t always living at home. i noticed that at the end of 8th grade, he was almost constantly on his phone and his laptop. then, during the summer, my parents just let him stay up in his room pretty much all day every day. as far as i can tell he was on his phone/laptop all of the time. his mood was always dour and anytime anyone tried to talk with him he acted like a typical teenager (rolling his eyes, not listening, etc). the only issues is that it was all of the time. i think over the summer he may have hung out with one of his friends one time. he doesn\\'t go outside, and he barely eats anything. if my biology is anything like his, i know that being outdoors greatly increases mood. so anyway, i was concerned and did some snooping. i found out he has had a twitter account for about a year (pretty much the same time he seemed to really disengage from the \"real world\") and a discord for i don\\'t know how long. he had become extremely private about his technology to the point that it reminded me of gollum and his precious ring. on his twitter i found out that he has an internet boyfriend that he has never seen or met in person. of course a lot of red flags went up for me, but i didn\\'t do anything except tell my mom that he has a twitter account and a discord. i suggested they ground him and actually talk to him about what he\\'s doing on the internet and give him some actual screen time limits. when my mom tried to bring this up with him he just started screaming and yelling. i saw on his twitter that he felt suicidal. i don\\'t know if i did the right thing by tattling on him, but i am just worried about the kid. my questions are, what can be done at this point? what can i and my folks do to get him back engaged with the real world and building friendships with other people that he knows? what is the best way to ween him off of this absolute addiction to technology? or, alternatively, am i just out of touch for tattling on him? tl;dr: found my kid brother talking online to strangers after about a year of him really disengaging from the \"real\" world. i am concerned about his mental health and how no outside time and not building real-life friendships is effecting him as a young teen.',\n",

       " \"shared care, am i being unreasonable? fornatting apologies, on mobile. i lnow this is a long story to share with strangers but i dont know where to turn. i was a naive teenager, had my first dd at 18 and separated from her dad when she was 1yo. shortly after i married my new partner, dd2 was stillborn, 2 years later dd3 is born. (ex) dh developed ptsd and ended up leaving when she was 18 months old. to keep a long story short, he lied in court saying i neglected the kids, i had enough evidence to prove that was false on the first court date and he was ordered to return kids. he begged for my forgiveness after court, explaining that he thought i was going to leave him and he couldn't risk losing another child. i forgave him that same day. admits it was lies to marriage counsellor, we try to work things out. 6 months later he does the same thing. this time it turns out there is undiagnosed mental health issues and drug addiction. court orders supervised visitation while he's in rehab, i facilitate visits and daily calls. i request supervised visits are revoked when i can see he's doing well. new orders state shared parental responsibility and he gets 4 nights a fortnight with his child. he does not get access to non biological child other than when he visits. orders have been in place for several years, we were the role model coparents. his mental health is off and on, in 6 years hes had four different jobs, started 3 uni degrees and a few stints on disability due to mental health. i studied for 2 years and did volunteer work then got my current job which ive held for 3 years and just got a promotion. hes currently on disability and almost went to hospital due to mental health last month. i'm not perfect, i have a mental health condition too although mine just requires medication. he also has this diagnosis but his is more complex. he met someone, 6 months later married them and they have been married a year now. ive been with my partner for 6 years, getting married in 2 months. we have always been flexible in what days he has her and i often let him have her on my weekends if he wants her for something. hes now informed me that he wants 50/50 'custody' and for her to go to a school half way between our houses (we live just over an hour apart). i already dislike the travel time she has to do on our current schedule but this proposition has her on a bus 13 hours a fortnight. bus pickup is at 7.30, 20 mins from my home, a 35 minute drive back from my other daughters school and then a 35 minute drive back to work, to not get there on time. my partner does school drop offs because i start work at 4am so i can be home to pick up kids at 3pm every day. this also means the girls would be spending a lot less time together as they are no longer at the same school. his income is 16k, mine is 45k fees are about 4k. if he can't pay his half i will have to pay them. current school is free. proposed school is definitely better than current, but there are other better schools closer to either of our houses. my partner and i both work close to our home, his wife has to fly to her job once every two weeks, airport is an hour from their home and 25 mins from ours. not sure if hes studying, last i heard he was on break due to mental health but uni is half way between our houses. they live in that suburb because they enjoy the lifestyle. so ex wants us to go to mediation (legally required before court here) but has already booked an interview with said school on a day i'm at work. has informed me that he will be filing urgent interim orders requesting she be moved to that school while we continue in court to come to an agreement. i have requested we start seeing a psych so they can get our history and give us actual best interest advice. i have an appointment with a lawyer on friday but i'm asking here, although i've obviously given my biased story, am i being unreasonable? i know he definitely is acting in what he thinks is her best interest (and it very well may be) but i get the feeling its not. obviously the psych and lawyer will give professional advice but i'd like to hear what others think so i can work out if i'm reacting normally. thanks for sticking with me if you read this far!\",\n",

(just want to state that i am not seeking medical advice, just advice from parents who have been through this!) 1. noticed lice on saturday. nits and live lice. called doctor and she said to treat with nix and to repeat in nine days. treated the girls hair on saturday, combed out everything i could. 2. about 18-24 hours later (on sunday) i recombed the girls hair. still found live lice, but less than 10 on each head. 3. it has now been 48 hours and i have found about five live lice on each of their heads. one of my daughters has several nits still. i can’t get them all out, but daily i am combing and pulling out what i can. my question is, is it normal to still see a few lice that are alive? they were very slow, barely moving. but when will they be gone? also, should i attempt to get every nit out of the hair? one of my daughters has to still have about 30 in her hair. maybe not that many, but it just seems like a lot. also, is it safe to send them to school? it came from school and the school has been notified. they do not have a no nit policy, and the doctor has said that the nits do not mean active infestation. blaaaah! i just want to make sure i am doing the right thing. this has been days of just googling, combing, washing, repeat. am i doing this right?!? creeped out momma',\n",

       " \"how much freedom do you give your 19 year old? hi, this is a little long so bear with me (tldr at bottom). i just had my first year in college living at the dorms and had a blast. i felt like i grew a lot in terms of how to manage my time, be more social and friendly to others, being more independent, and also being less fearful of making phone calls (haha). mentally, i felt much happier and more confident in myself (i struggled a lot with self esteem issues growing up). unfortunately, when i came back from the dorms this summer i found myself feeling depressed, lonely, and bored a lot of the time. one issue i face is going out of the house. i got my license in january of my high school senior year but i'm not allowed to drive unless one of my parents is in the car. sometimes there are days where i just want to hang out at a coffee shop or library rather than stay cooped up in my house, but my mom (my dad is usually working)is usually not up for accompanying me in the car if i'm not going anywhere without much of a purpose. i don't blame her for not wanting to go with me, as she can't help it if she's not interested in going out and she isn't obligated to. yet i feel trapped in the house and, as silly as it sounds, feel like i'm wasting my life being in the house all day long. to make things worse, i recently got a job and my mom has to drive me there, but i feel like she has to go out of her way to do so since she has other responsibilities to tend to and i feel really guilty for making her do so. when i lived in the dorms, i could walk to the library to study/ hang out or even just take a walk around campus if i didn't want to stay in my dorm. another scenario would be hanging out with friends. ever since i was a kid, if i hung out with a guy friend or acquaintance(never one-on-one/ always with another female friend or in a group) my parents would ask if i have any romantic interests in him. i had a boyfriend in the past and kept it hidden in fear of them being angry, but they eventually found out. they weren't very angry, more concerned, but i would guess it would create further distrust. during college, i made some guy friends that i hung out with a lot and while i used to be afraid to talk to guys, i no longer have that fear. however recently, when i mentioned my friend, a (male), in a conversation, my mom asked me if i had feelings for him. i don't have feelings for him, nor am i interested in dating at the moment (i feel like i need to really focus on myself for a couple years), and i felt awkward and embarrassed when she mentioned that. so i was wondering if its normal for parents to ask that question whenever their daughter has a guy friend or not. my parents have good intentions. i know they care a lot about me and my sibling and want the best for us. they always invest a lot of money in our education to make sure we get the best kind and push academics as a priority. but sometimes i feel like overall happiness and success is more than just academics and things like a social life can really contribute to it. so what boundaries do you set for your 19 year old regarding when they go out to hang with friends or just stay out? tldr: after staying in the dorms for freshman year, i miss the freedom i had there and was wondering what are some normal boundaries parents have for a 19 year old who lives at home.\",\n",

       " 'what boundaries should i set between myself and children (specifically 6yo godson and random kids who approach me)? tl;dr at the bottom for shortened versions of my q\\'s. so first and foremost: parental consent is something i will always support. i believe firmly in asking a parent\\'s permission before playing with, speaking about subjects children don\\'t bring up themselves (had a parent scream at me for asking their kid if they liked pokemon before), or friending a child on apps like pokemon go. i never ask for personal information and if a child gives me that information, i tell them not to give their information to strangers and decline. in my definition of children, i include individuals of 0-17 years. i ask this question because my friend (30f), myself (22f), and her 5 yr old child went to the community center so he could play in the indoor play place there. the play place has a small play area at one end of the room and a row of chairs and tables along the other end. i was sitting at one of the tables with her and playing phone games when a child (maybe 14-15, didn\\'t ask) sat down with us and started talking. his siblings were playing in the play place with my friend\\'s child so she mostly watched him but added a few bits to the conversation. the kid said he was asked to take his siblings here but he gets bored as his phone was taken away. he asked to play on my phone, which i declined. he noticed my pokemon pin and we started to talk about pokemon. we shook hands, introduced ourselves, and talked pokemon for a bit. after about 15 minutes, his group left after he introduced me to his younger siblings (probably 10 and 5, by appearance). very polite kid on all accounts who accepted my no with a simple no prob. my friend remarked that it was incredibly creepy and strange for me to talk to kids and that i should\\'ve just ignored him or told him not to talk to me because i was an adult. is this a common belief? i honestly don\\'t know, as i\\'m so used to being polite and exchanging pleasantries with everyone. i probably should\\'ve just said he shouldn\\'t talk to strangers without his parent\\'s approval and ignored him, i guess? with younger kids i practice this, but older kids (like 12 and up to me) i tend to not worry so much about a brief conversation they initiate. is this wrong and how should i conduct myself in the future if it is? and one more question about boundaries: how should i establish boundaries with my godson (6m)? i know what i can and can\\'t talk about with him, what he can play with, what he can\\'t do anymore, etc...as his mother and i have talked about it at length. but, sometimes, he will come up to me and \"honk\" on my breasts or butt because he finds it funny and climb on me like a jungle gym. he will often lick my face and arm randomly, push his hands against my face, and headbutt my stomach. i have told him multiple times that the actions aren\\'t okay and that he shouldn\\'t do that to anybody. he usually understands for a few hours but he goes right back to it. i have talked to his mother about it and she\\'s spoken to him as well. should i just be more firm in my no or is there a particular way to go about getting him to stop this behavior? i don\\'t encourage, smile, or laugh at the behavior as i was told to do by his mother, but it just doesn\\'t seem to be enough. thanks for reading...i thought that i should ask parents their opinions on how people interact with children. i have no children of my own but have often been seen as a kind of caretaker by other adults because i was the oldest at daycare and took care of my younger brother and his friends. i worry about my interactions with children a lot because of my family life and really want to be a decent adult. i hope these questions aren\\'t out of place here...help, please? tl;dr: how should i conduct myself around roughly 12-17 yr olds who come up to me and start talking to me? should i just decline to speak to them without their guardian\\'s permission/presence? /and/ how do i set boundaries with regards to inappropriate grabbing from my 6 yr old godson?',\n",
       " 'anyone have a child that didn’t consistently speak more than 10 words and everything turn out fine? my oldest just turned two, and at his well child exam we got a referral to speech therapy. in every other way he is meeting appropriate milestones for his age, except in regards to speech. i have been aware of this for the past year, and i have tried everything that i can reasonably think of to encourage him to speak. whenever he babbles to me, i enthusiastically respond as though he added some tidbit to my ongoing conversation. i narrate things throughout the day— mommy is washing the dishes, let’s let the dog out, come help mommy do laundry, etc... he has a huge collection of books and i read to him for at least an hour every day— he has his favorites, so i always read those and then rotate the non-favorite books through the reading list just so i don’t go mad... it’s amazing how many kids books i can recite in my sleep... i try to have him interact with the story as we are reading it— if the book is about a mouse and bear i like to ask him to point to whatever character is being discussed on that page— sometimes he gets quite a bit of it right, and other times seemingly not at all. i purchased toddler word flash cards— he is interested in looking at the pictures, but no matter how many times i repeat the word and ask him to say it he doesn’t even attempt to say it. he now only consistently says 7 words: all forms of mommy, all forms of daddy, baby, wawa, baba, pool, and car. he used to say dog, but i haven’t been able to get him to say that for quite a while now. for lack of a better explanation, he just does not seem interested in speaking words right now. but he will randomly say things we don’t necessarily expect him to say. recently when i put him to bed i said, “night night, bubba” and he immediately replied, “night night momma”. he said truck the first time my husband asked him to say it, but we can’t get him to repeat any of these words. our pediatrician made a seemingly innocuous comment about the possibility of speech delays being caused by autism. i felt that she was implying our son might have autism, but my husband disagrees... i’m even more convinced now that she was suggesting that it might be a possibility after i googled autism and found that she had mentioned autism after she had asked us all of the questions on the “modified checklist for autism in toddlers, revised” questionnaire. other than his speech delay he doesn’t have any of the other characteristics that are associated with autism. should i be more concerned? then i’m somewhat nervous about the speech therapy referral... i’d personally welcome any help and encouragement to get him to talk, but for the last year he has been pretty wary of adult strangers, and though it is lessening a bit, i’m trying to fathom how long it will take for him to even warm up to the speech therapist for there to be any evaluation and/or therapy?? advice would be appreciated!!',\n",

       " 'power struggle with 8yo daughter. some background: my husband and i are always on the same page as far as expectations of our 8 yo daughter. she is expected to clean up after herself around the house (she needs reminders) and she is supposed to put her folded laundry away. also, we like her to keep her room reasonably clean. not perfect, but at least you can walk through it. (it\\'s small, and no other toy storage anywhere else) when it gets bad enough (i.e. i can\\'t walk to her bed without stepping on and breaking something) i kiss her goodnight in the doorway (which she hates, but i love natural consequences) also, while her room is a disaster, all screen privileges are revoked. about once or twice a year her room will get so bad that i give her the classic ultimatum \"clean it or i will\" and she knows i will give away things (most if the time she doesn\\'t remember what\\'s missing) a few times i\\'ve found myself putting some of her folded clothes in the washing machine, so twice now i\\'ve had her wash a load from start to finish her own clothes. last month she and i went through all of her clothes, and donated some, she organized everything in her dresser. yesterday. i asked her to put her laundry away right away \"before the cats knocked the piles over again\". i left her room and came back 60 seconds later to give her something, to see the 3 stacks of laundry was already put away. i checked her dresser and saw she had been randomly shoving several piles of clothes wherever. i immediately took out everything and put it on her bed. \"now you can start all over again\" furious. i told her she was washing her own laundry from now on. (i\\'ve been doing my own since 4th grade, doesn\\'t seem unreasonable). her reaction was blase (gave zero &#(@#s.) she put some things away slowly. and hour later after hearing some crashing i discover she\\'s put the mound of clothes on the floor on a blanket and she\\'s moved her bed and a bookcase (it fell over). what had been an ok room is a disaster again. and she\\'s not doing anything about it. she starts school in 3 days, and all i want to do is pare everything down again. (maybe she genuinely cannot handle so many belongings). or do i just let her have it the way it is?? i\\'m sorry for the long post. she\\'s our only child, so i don\\'t quite know what\\'s \"normal\" ...not that there is a normal. but are we expecting too much of her, or am i hurting her by donating things as a consequence??',\n",
