# Dataset

The train, validation and test sets from r/AskParents and r/needadvice are provided in separate `tsv` files with the following columns:
- `ID`: The ID consists of the submission ID (randomly generated by Reddit), followed by the local reply number, followed by the position of the sentence within the reply. Sentences with the same submission ID and local reply number are written by the same author.
- `Majority_label`: Majority label (1 or 0) assigned by 3 annotators to that sentence span.
- `DS_Label`: Dawid-Skene label (1 or 0) assigned to sentence span.
- `Sentence`: The sentence text, tokenized using spaCy.

The r/needadvice datasets have an additional `Flair` column that indicates one of 5 possible flairs -- Education, Career, Mental Health, Life Decisions, and Friendships.
